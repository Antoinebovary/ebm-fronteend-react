# EBM Application System

## **Project Description**

### **Technical Perspective**
The **EBM Application System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of applying for Electronic Billing Machine (EBM) access in Rwanda. By integrating modern web technologies, this system allows users to register, apply for EBM devices, and track their application status online. It eliminates the need for physical visits to the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) offices, saving time and resources for both users and administrators.

Key features include:  
1. **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in functionalities for businesses and individuals.
2. **Application Submission**: A user-friendly interface to submit detailed EBM requests.
3. **Application Status Tracking**: Real-time updates on application progress.
4. **Admin Management Dashboard**: Tools for administrators to review and approve applications efficiently.  

The system is built using the following technologies:  
- **Frontend**: React.js for a dynamic and interactive user experience.  
- **Backend**: Spring boot java for server-side operations.  
- **Database**: Postgres for secure and efficient data storage.  
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions.  

### **Business Perspective**
This application aligns with the RRA's mission to improve service delivery and enhance taxpayer compliance by digitizing EBM access. It serves as a bridge between the government and businesses, fostering a culture of tax transparency and compliance. The system reduces administrative workload, enhances data accuracy, and promotes accountability.  

Key business benefits include:  
1. **Accessibility**: Users can apply from anywhere, 24/7.  
2. **Efficiency**: Minimizes delays and manual errors associated with paper-based processes.  
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces operational costs for both users and the RRA.  
4. **Compliance Assurance**: Encourages businesses to comply with tax regulations by simplifying the EBM acquisition process.
